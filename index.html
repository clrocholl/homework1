    <p><b>Where will 2018 take you?</b></p>
    <p>If you like to travel like me, you <em>probably</em> have a bucket list of places you want to visit throughout your lifetime. If you don't have a list, I'll share mine with you to give you ideas, tips, and recommendations.</p>
    <h2>Destinations</h2>
    <p>Are you ready to start planning your dream trip? Check out my travel bucket list:</p>
    <h3>Africa</h3>
    <p>Africa has 54 sovereign countries—the most on any continent—and is the second largest continent in terms of both land area and population. While the first activity most people associate with Africa is safaris, there are endless possibilities for adventure. You can purchase crafts in markets, venture into the Sahara with a Tuareg caravan, visit pygmy villages, hike through jungle to watch gorillas, relax on tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, experience arguably the world's best wildlife safaris, snack on exotic treats, travel down a river in a dugout "pirogue", travel across savannah on a colonial-era railway, and much more. Kenya and Morocco are my top two recommendations to visit in Africa.</p>
    <h4>Kenya</h4>
    <p>Kenya is the <em>most</em> powerful economy of East Africa and is also a middle income country with a fast growing middle class, however, it is still a developing country, and so certain aspects of the country's society and infrastructure may come as a shock to some visitors from developed countries who are unfamiliar with the quality of life experienced by many Kenyans. What to visit in Kenya?</p>
    <h5>Nairobi</h5>
    <p>Nairobi is the capital of Kenya and the largest city in the country. The word Nairobi derives from a water hole known in Maasai (an Eastern Nilotic language) as Enkare Nyirobi, which means "cool waters." Nairobi, which was a swamp area, was founded in 1899 and was first a railway camp for the Uganda Railway.</p>
    <h6>Mahali Mzuri</h6>
    <p>Mahali Mzuri means <i>“beautiful place”</i> in Swahili. This safari camp is part of the private Olare Motorogi Conservancy, located in Kenya’s Maasai Mara ecosystem. Easily <strong>one of the most breathtaking places in Africa</strong>.</p>
    <h6>The Giraffe Manor</h6>
    <p>If you want to turn back time to see Kenya the way it looked in the 1930s, check out The Safari Collection’s Giraffe Manor. Incredibly preserved and sitting on top of 140 acres of land, this place is like stepping into a dream.</p>

    <h4>Morocco</h4>
    <p>Morocco is a North African country that has a coastline on both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. At just a few hours from the main European cities, Morocco has everything to overwhelm you with the amazing colors, smells and sounds of Islamic Africa. Imagine bustling souqs and spice markets, stunning mosques, white-washed sea side towns and medieval city centres. With panoramic views varying from snow-covered peaks in the High Atlas to the endless sand dunes of the Sahara, no-one ever has to be bored in this beautiful country.</p>
    <h5>Marrakech</h5>
    <p>Easily one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in Morocco, no trip to Northern Africa is complete without checking out Marrakech. Marrakech is a perfect combination of old and new Morocco. Plan to spend at least a few days wandering the huge maze of souks and ruins in the medina. The great plaza of Djeema El Fna at dusk is not to be missed although the sheer number and concentration of tourists may be off putting for some. My hotel recommendation is the Riad Yasmine. This boutique hotel is a quiet oasis in the center of the buzzing city, it could easily be one of Morocco’s most impressive riads. For more information about this hotel, see <a href="https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Riad_Yasmine.htm">Riad Yasmine</a>.</p>
    <h3>North America</h3>
    <p>North America is one of two continents named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. It consists of three large nations and one large island territory that covers most of its area. They are Canada, the United States of America (USA), Mexico and Greenland.</p>
    <p>Basically any activity imaginable is possible in North America. Major cities have a wide variety of attractions, including museums, amusement parks, concerts, and sporting events. Smaller cities and towns generally have at least a few things to do, though often with less availability than larger centres, but even smaller towns will often have a bar with occasional live music, a minor-league sports team, and/or a small museum somewhere.</p>
    <h4>Canada</h4>
    <p>Canada is a land of vast distances and rich natural beauty. Economically and technologically, and in many other ways she closely resembles her neighbour to the south, the United States, although there are significant differences between the two countries.</p>
    <h5>Toronto</h5>
    <p>Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the provincial capital of Ontario. Toronto has so many eclectic neighbourhoods that a random walk is fascinating in its own right. You might start in the Downtown area and then try other neighbourhoods around the city. For more information, see <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Toronto">Toronto</a>.</p>
    <h4>United States of America</h4>
    <p>The United States is extraordinarily diverse in its array of attractions. You will <strong>never</strong> run out of things to see; even if you think you've exhausted what one place has to offer, the next destination is <em>only</em> a road trip away.</p>
    <h5>New York City</h5>
    <p>New York City is a center for media, culture, food, fashion, art, research, finance, and trade. It has one of the largest and most famous skylines on earth, dominated by the iconic Empire State Building. For more information, see <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/New_York_City">New York City</a></p>
    <h5>Los Angeles</h5>
    <p>Los Angeles is an important center of culture, medicine, agriculture, business, finance, energy, aerospace, science, food processing, media, international trade, and tourism.</p>
    <h6>Hollywood</h6>
    <p>A business and residential district in the city of Los Angeles, the core of Hollywood for a tourist is its three fascinating boulevards: Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, and Melrose Avenue. All three are worth seeing. Hollywood Blvd. is known for its entertainment history; Sunset Blvd. for its clubs and nightlife; and Melrose Ave. for its shopping, nightlife, and eclecticism.</p>
    <h3>Central America</h3>
    <p>The seven small nations of this isthmus connecting North and South America blend elements of both continents; you'll find bustling cities, long coastlines, ancient jungle ruins, and Spanish-tinged mestizo and Afro-Indian cultures.</p>
    <h3>South America</h3>
    <p>Nestled between the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic Oceans, South America is the wilder of the Americas, and a continent of superlatives. The world's biggest rainforest and the largest river (Amazon), the highest mountain range outside Asia (the Andes), remote islands (Galapagos Islands, Easter Island and Fernando de Noronha), heavenly beaches (such as in Brazil's Northeastern region), wide deserts (Atacama), icy landscapes (Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego), the world's tallest waterfall (the 979m Angel Falls, in Venezuela) and one of the largest (Iguaçu Falls, Argentina and Brazil), as well as several other breathtaking natural attractions.</p>
