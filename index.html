    <p><b>Where will 2018 take you?</b></p>
    <p>If you like to travel like me, you <em>probably</em> have a bucket list of places you want to visit throughout your lifetime. If you don't have a list, I'll share mine with you to give you ideas, tips, and recommendations.</p>
    <h2>Destinations</h2>
    <p>Are you ready to start planning your dream trip? Check out my travel bucket list:</p>
    <h3>Africa</h3>
    <p>Africa has 54 sovereign countries—the most on any continent—and is the second largest continent in terms of both land area and population. Africa is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, by the Red Sea to the northeast, and by the Indian Ocean to the southeast. While the first activity most people associate with Africa is safaris, there are endless possibilities for adventure. You can purchase crafts in markets, venture into the Sahara with a Tuareg caravan, visit pygmy villages, hike through jungle to watch gorillas, relax on tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, experience arguably the world's best wildlife safaris, snack on exotic treats, travel down a river in a dugout "pirogue", travel across savannah on a colonial-era railway, and much more. Kenya and Morocco are my top two recommendations to visit in Africa.</p>
    <h4>Kenya</h4>
    <p>Kenya is the most powerful economy of East Africa and is also a middle income country with a fast growing middle class, however, it is still a developing country, and so certain aspects of the country's society and infrastructure may come as a shock to some visitors from developed countries who are unfamiliar with the quality of life experienced by many Kenyans. What to visit in Kenya?</p>
    <h5>Nairobi</h5>
    <p>Nairobi is the capital of Kenya and the largest city in the country. The word Nairobi derives from a water hole known in Maasai (an Eastern Nilotic language) as Enkare Nyirobi, which means "cool waters." Nairobi, which was a swamp area, was founded in 1899 and was first a railway camp for the Uganda Railway.</p>
    <h6>Mahali Mzuri</h6>
    <p>Mahali Mzuri means <i>“beautiful place”</i> in Swahili. This safari camp is part of the private Olare Motorogi Conservancy, located in Kenya’s Maasai Mara ecosystem. Easily <strong>one of the most breathtaking places in Africa</strong>.</p>
    <h6>The Giraffe Manor</h6>
    <p>If you want to turn back time to see Kenya the way it looked in the 1930s, check out The Safari Collection’s Giraffe Manor. Incredibly preserved and sitting on top of 140 acres of land, this place is like stepping into a dream.</p>

    <h4>Morocco</h4>
    <p>Morocco is a North African country that has a coastline on both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. At just a few hours from the main European cities, Morocco has everything to overwhelm you with the amazing colors, smells and sounds of Islamic Africa. Imagine bustling souqs and spice markets, stunning mosques, white-washed sea side towns and medieval city centres. With panoramic views varying from snow-covered peaks in the High Atlas to the endless sand dunes of the Sahara, no-one ever has to be bored in this beautiful country.</p>
    <h5>Marrakech</h5>
    <p>Easily one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in Morocco, no trip to Northern Africa is complete without checking out Marrakech. Marrakech is a perfect combination of old and new Morocco. Plan to spend at least a few days wandering the huge maze of souks and ruins in the medina. The great plaza of Djeema El Fna at dusk is not to be missed although the sheer number and concentration of tourists may be off putting for some. My hotel recommendation is the Riad Yasmine. This boutique hotel is a quiet oasis in the center of the buzzing city, it could easily be one of Morocco’s most impressive riads.
